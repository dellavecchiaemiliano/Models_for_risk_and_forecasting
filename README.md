# Models_for_risk_and_forecasting
The course included several applied projects focused on quantitative methods and Python programming:

Project 1 – Data manipulation with Pandas: introductory assignment aimed at building data analysis pipelines and efficient data cleaning workflows using the pandas library.

Project 2 – Factor investing with Support Vector Classifier: using 20 years of data for over one thousand North American and Canadian stocks and 95 potential explanatory factors, I performed a grid-search-based validation of a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model. The goal was to identify the optimal combination of kernel functions and their parameters for predicting monthly stock returns within a factor investing framework.

Project 3 – Frequentist vs Bayesian parameter estimation: implemented in Python, this project compared the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference. Starting from a Bernoulli/Binomial process, I estimated parameters through Maximum Likelihood Estimation and posterior inference using Bayes’ theorem. The analysis emphasized how prior beliefs, likelihood functions, and sample size influence uncertainty and model convergence.

All projects include full Python code, visualizations, and documentation available on this GitHub repository.
