# Models_for_risk_and_forecasting
Second year, second semester of master's degree "finance and insurance" with curriculum "financial risk and data analysis". The first project of the course is an assignment about pandas library. The second one is a project about grid search for validation set. I had 20 years of data about more than a thousand stocks (North America and Canada) and 95 factors that may have influenced monthly stock returns. The objective was to validate through grid search a support vector classifier model for factor investing. Thus, I searched for the best combination of some kernel functions and the relative parameters in an iterative way.
